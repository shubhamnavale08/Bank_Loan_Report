# Bank_Loan_Report

### ✅️Introduction
As part of my recent project, I developed a comprehensive loan analytics dashboard using Power BI, SQL, and Excel. This dashboard is designed to provide in-depth insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) critical to the operations of a lending institution. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly and interactive interface that enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze various metrics related to loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.

### ✅️Overview
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using Excel, SQL and Power BI, aimed at deriving actionable insights into loan performance metrics, borrower profiles, and market trends.

### ✅️Business Objectives
+ **Objective** : Utilize advanced SQL queries and Power BI visualizations to analyze and interpret key metrics related to bank loan applications, disbursements, and borrower demographics.
+ **Strategic Goals** : Enhance decision-making processes and operational efficiency by leveraging data-driven insights from the analysis.

### ⚒️SOFTWARE USED
+ **MS Excel**
+ **MySQL**
+ **Power BI**
+ **Power Query**
##### Database :- Excel
  
### ⏬️PROBLEM STATEMENT
### DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
+ **Total Loan Applications** : We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
+ **Total Funded Amount** : Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
+ **Total Amount Received** : Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
+ **Average Interest Rate** : Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
+ **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** : Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

#### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s
##### Good Loan:
+ Good Loan Application Percentage
+ Good Loan Applications
+ Good Loan Funded Amount
+ Good Loan Total Received Amount
##### Bad Loan :
+ Bad Loan Application Percentage
+ Bad Loan Applications
+ Bad Loan Funded Amount
+ Bad Loan Total Received Amount

#### Loan Status Grid View :
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.
